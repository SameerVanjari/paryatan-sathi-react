# Paryatan Sathi | A Travel advisor guide

https://paryatan-sathi.netlify.app 

This is a app which will give you recommendations on Restaurants, Hotels and Attractions of a certain spot you wish to visit.

## This App Uses the following APIs:
-Google Maps API
-Google Places API
-Open Weather Maps API
-Travel Advisor API

In this app I tried to use the API and implement them into a webapp in React.js. It was a huge success, as I implemented multiple APIs into a single app for the first time. 

Using the *Google Maps* Api was convenient. I also got to use APIs from the RapidApi and it was super easy to implement and work with them.

The *Weather Maps* API that is implemented here shows the weather of the particular region, if you ever plan to visit the *Attractions*.

It also has the features of filtering the results on basis of the ratings based on the reviews. Also clicking on the card in map will direct you to a card that displays all the relevant information about the place.
